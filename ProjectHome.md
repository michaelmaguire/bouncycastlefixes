Our team has done some work with the Bouncy Castle project.

We think the Bouncy Castle team has done a great job, and we are grateful to them and the Bouncy Castle community.

In this project we publish our contribution back to the open source community of Bouncy Castle changes and fixes which we haven't yet had a chance to submit back to the main trunk.

Not trying to do anything political or create a fork -- just trying to make sure we contribute all our changes to this open source software back to the community.

Consider it a QA/experimental branch if you will.
